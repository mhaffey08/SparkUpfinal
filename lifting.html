      <div class="text-box1">
        This lifting schedule will have three seperate days: A push day, pull
        day, and a leg day. Each will provide the most optimal exercises for the
        muscle groups. You'll train your hardest each rep, to the end of each
        set.
      </div>

      <div class="text-box2">
        At the end of every set, do partial repetitions to stimulate the muscle
        even more.
      </div>

      <div class="text-box3">
        For compound movements such as bench press, squat, or barbell rows, rest
        for 3.5 minutes in between sets. For isolation movments such as preacher
        curls, tricep pushdown, or leg extensions, wait 2.5 minutes between
        sets.
